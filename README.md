# binary_pattern_match_classification

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates binarized pattern matching using neural networks. The project leverages the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a model that can perform pattern matching on binarized images.

## Overview

Binarized pattern matching involves converting images to binary format (black and white) and using neural networks to identify and match patterns within these images. This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, a well-known image dataset, to train and evaluate the model's performance on binarized image data.

## Features

Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing.
Converts images to grayscale and binarizes them.
Trains a neural network model for pattern matching.
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Jaccard similarity.
